# QtClientServer
So, in this laboratory work, two programs were developed in C++ using the Qt framework.
One program serves as a client, and the other as a server.
The TCP/IP protocol is used to establish communication between them.

The client sends data to the server.
The server, in turn, calculates the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation and then returns them to the client.

To enable connection over the internet, a virtual server was created on the router, which is bound to the port of my computer's server.
